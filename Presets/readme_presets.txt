Note for MANBOW2.RCP
--------------------
To be able to run the game from FlashROM and to get SCC sound, the ROM must be patched. Below are
the addresses and the byte values that must be there. Please note that there are Release 1 and 2
ROMs, so this patch must be done at one of those 2 addresses depending on the ROM's release:

2CBAh: 00 00 (Release 2, the original bytes are 20 FC) 
..or..
2CBDh: 00 00 (Release 1, the original bytes are 20 FC)

Some ROMs you find may be already patched to use PSG instead of SCC. So it's recommended to also
apply this patch to get SCC sound:

07D9h: D3 10
07DCh: D3 11
07EDh: DB 12
0824h: 0E 11
